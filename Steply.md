## Elevator

<!-- A one or two sentence synopsis of what your idea is. -->

Give user a great experience walking. Its the most basic thing we do but is there a way to improve it.
When was the last time you went for a walk and could relax. What if you could go anywhere or even close to where you live and know what other people think or what was their experience. Or where are the best places to go for a walk?

## Audience

My audience would include be aimed at people who like being outdoors but not necessarily joggers.
It would be aimed at couples looking for a romantic walk to pet owners looking for a place to walk their dog.


<!-- Further note: Your idea might have a few different audiences. -->

## Benefits

Living in Indianapolis one thing I've heard many times is, its impossible to walk anywhere(except downtown). There are many nice places to go for walk but they are hard to find. My app would map places have parks or walking trails, in a few simple steps you can know where you can go walking. With the added benefit of hearing from others experience or even on opening the app share a brief experience.
<!-- Why said audience would use this thing. What do they get out of it? -->

## Features

It would map specifically parks with walking trails and high traffic areas, also it would include biking trails. Ideally it would know where a user is located and give them the nearest place to walk. Even better would be to give a person the nearest side walk, if possible things like escalators would be shown(probably not possible). It would also include reviews from what other fellow walkers think of that particular place to walk. What is great? bad? so so?

What the thing _does_. Note that this is different than the above.

## Technology

It would rely on google map apis, parks apis from data.gov , and user contribution.
<!-- Specific APIs, integrations and technologies you expect to use. -->

## Why you should help me build this

Making this app would help the local community by giving providing them information on where we can walk. It could be for fun or maybe for work. This is also a way to bring our local community together in doing something that literally costs nothing to do by bringing an experience that is fun, easy and simple.
