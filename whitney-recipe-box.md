# Recipe Box (Whitney)

## Elevator

The recipe box app will use the BigOven API to allow users to search for, save, and add recipes to their account.  The user will be able to interact with saved recipes to adjust the size (e.g. double or cut in half) and create grocery lists from the list of ingredients.

## Audience

This app appeals to a wide audience - from cooking enthusiasts who want to browse over 350,000 recipes to first time cooks who are looking for something easy to try out.

Anyone who is tired of trying to find old, hand-written recipes (maybe things they only make once or twice a year during the holidays) can use the Recipe Box to save and make the recipes easily accessible in the future.

## Why you should help me build this

The BigOven API provides a lot of information that will allow us to create an app with several different features and benefits - it also looks relatively easy to use.  We can break up the features into various React components that will make splitting the work up easy.  We could use the final result to find and make recipes in the future!
