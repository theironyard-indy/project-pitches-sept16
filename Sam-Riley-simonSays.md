# Project Pitch Name (Your Name)

## Elevator

An SMS text service that sends texts for you at some future scheduled time.

## Audience

Anyone who uses text messaging can use this service. It would probably be used by people that may need to send texts at future points in time as reminders, or be used by companies for marketing & sales.


## Benefits

Benefits would include a more scheduled approach to sending text messages, whether it personal or business. It is a preferred method of communication by a lot of people.

## Features

What the thing _does_. Note that this is different than the above.

    The user will send a text message to the the app with instructions to send a text at a specific time. App will use a database to hold the text message, and send it off at the appropriate time. The receiver will get a message from the app stating the number that originated the text, and the message that they sent.
    The app will have a login page which brings you to a list of all the texts that are waiting to be sent, which you could delete or edit. The list will be similar to the Todo app

## Technology

Specific APIs, integrations and technologies you expect to use.
I plan on using React or React Native for the Front-End. The back-end could potentially be written in Adonis.
Twilio would be ideal for messaging and authentication.

## Why you should help me build this

Make a pitch for a peer to help you with this project.
Who hasn't wanted to be able to send a text out at some future point and then forgot?  Why set a reminder to contact someone when you can simply just send a text that reaches them at the desired time? The app will be simple and easy to use when finished, providing an extra layer to text messaging.
