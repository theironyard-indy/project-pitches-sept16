FIRST IDEA:

# Project Pitch - Kyle Huff

## Elevator

Create an application that serves as a plug-in to social media sites to help combat fake news postings.  App would clearly identify posts from reputed fake-news-posting websites and furthermore recommend factual news stories over similar subject matter from reputable news outlets.

## Audience

Anyone who uses social media would benefit from this app.  

## Benefits

A more informed society.  Far too many people are reliant solely on social media for their news, let's make it more accurate.

## Features

While it doesn't limit or restrict posts on the social media, the fake-news (identified by user input or simply based on the posting website's reputation as determined by application team) will be clearly marked as such.  Have a button available to click or possibly hover over to display other posts from that particular social media site which cover a similar subject matter and have been validated as reliable news sources.

## Technology

An API from multiple reputable news sources would be required.  I don't know very much about building 'plug-ins' for apps (like Facebook and Twitter) but this would need to work seamlessly with those.

## Why you should help me build this

This is an important issue that needs to be addressed.  

SECOND IDEA:

# Project Pitch - Kyle Huff

## Elevator

Build a website/app that allows you to search for a specific item or something more broad (like 'Indiana sports memorabilia' or 'Star Wars collectibles'), establish a price you're looking to spend on said item and then texts/emails you when a match has been found for what you're looking to buy.  

## Audience

People who shop online and are looking to save money on the things they shop for.

## Benefits

Users will save money on their purchases and also save time trying to find what they're looking for.

## Features

Very simple interface.  Users type what they're looking for (and can perhaps even reference exact items/SKUs from other sites), determine the price they want to spend and submit.  Once submitted there could also be a 'other users searched for' section.  Users will create login and could make purchase of desired item (wherever it is found) directly from this app. 

## Technology

An API from multiple online stores like Etsy, eBay and Amazon would be required to search for and eventually present a matching item.  Would need to use a service like Stripe for payment processing.

## Why you should help me build this

This would be a challenging app to build with lots of opportunity for design creativity.
