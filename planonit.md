# Plan on it

## Elevator

I want to make a website with an app to be able to plan a party with a diy/ease. 

## Audience


The target audience is for people with little to no experience on how to plan a party.  This could be planning a simple birthday party, to a wedding.  I want the site to be user friendly and easy to follow directions. 

## Benefits

I came from an event planning background and I also search for how to plan for certain events and I have to do a little digging to where I want to go.  I want this to an easy process so anybody can jump in and plan.  I also have a culinary background and use that plan the perfect party. 

## Features

 The main page will have the party or parties that you have saved that is on-going.....  You can search for a party to plan. When you create a party,  there are categories.   Within these categories, there are different levels on how you want your party to be minimal to overboard.   Users can collaborate with other people to divide the tasks and upload receipts to keep track of expenses.  Use a simple budget system to keep on track of the expense.

## Technology

Use React for the main page and using the search in the database to upload different parties.  Somehow use eventbrite api to track event attendees through the app.  use food api for recipes? (not sure about this one.  might be for phase 2)

## Why you should help me build this

No idea in mind.
