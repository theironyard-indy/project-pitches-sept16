# Plan on it

## Elevator

To make a website with an app, to plan a party with a diy ease.  

## Audience


The target audience is for people with little to no experience on how to plan a party.  This could be planning a simple birthday party, to a grand opening.  I want the site to be user friendly and easy to follow directions. 

## Benefits

I came from an event planning background and I also search for how to plan for certain events and I have to do a little digging to where I want to go.  I want this to be an easy process so anybody can jump in and plan.  I have a culinary background and I want to use my knowledge and catering experience to have an awesome planned party!

## Features

 The main page will have the party or parties that are saved to your account.  You can search for a party theme to plan. When you create a party,  there are multiple categories, such as decorations, food, dessert, ect....   Within these categories, there are different levels on how you want your party to be minimal or to go overboard.   Users can also invite other people to collaborate and divide the tasks. I would also love to have an option to upload receipts to keep track of expenses. 
 
## Technology

Use React for the main page and using the search in the database to upload different party data.  Somehow use eventbrite api to track event attendees through the app.  use food api for recipes? (not sure about this one.  might be for phase 2)

## Why you should help me build this

Nobody in mind.
