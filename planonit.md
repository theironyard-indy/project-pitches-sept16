# Plan on it

## Elevator

I want to make a website with an app to be able to plan a party with a diy/ease. You can search how to plan for a particular party on the internet, but I feel like there is no centralized site to plan if you don't know where to start.  

## Audience

I came from an event planning background and I also search for how to plan for certain events and I have to do a little digging to where I want to go.  I want this to an easy process so anybody can jump in and plan.  I also have a culinary background and use that plan the perfect party. 

## Benefits

The target audience is for people with little to no experience on how to plan a party and they can also collaborate with other people to divide the tasks and upload receipts. 

## Features

 The main page will have the party or parties that you have saved that is on-going.....  You can search for a party to plan. When you create a party,  there are categories.   Within these categories, there are different levels on how you want your party to be minimal to overboard.  

## Technology

Use React for the main page and using the search in the database to upload different parties.  Somehow use eventbrite api to track event attendees through the app.  use food api for recipes? (not sure about this one.  might be for phase 2)

## Why you should help me build this

No idea in mind.
