# Project Pitch Name (Jeff Bumgardner)

Brew Live (or Live Brew, depends on how many you've had.)

## Elevator
Home brewing can be an expensive hobby when someone is doing it on there own. Why isn't there a place that not only allows to you to meet up with fellow home brewers, but also allows to maximize the ingredients, tools and knowledge you possess? Luckily, Brew Live is in the early stages of being built. Muahahaha!!

## Audience

This application will target those who would like to brew their own beer instead of buying pre-made beer. That would be the vast majority of the population. Some sub-populations could be:
--people looking into starting home brewing but want to see it happen first with experienced brewers.
--Someone looking up ingredients for beers to purchase somewhere else.
--Someone drunkenly searching the web, blacks out, forgets what they're doing, and signs up to brewing for 45 days straight as some sort of internal ironman challenge they gave themselves.

## Benefits

Why said audience would use this thing. What do they get out of it?

People who like to home brew would use this for many instances. Here are a few examples:

-meet new home brewers.
-make beers using resources they already have. (possibly combined ingredients between users. We shall see)
-Learning/teaching home brewing with people who are as interested in it as you are. human interaction
-cost saving. By not wasting ingredients/supplies. Also teaming up with other people to cut costs.


## Features

What the thing _does_. Note that this is different than the above.

What this app, Brew Live, will do is connect people with the common interest in brewing their own beer. You can do this by seeing brew dates in your area (using Google Location API), and connecting with users via messaging (using the pusher plugin for real-time chatting.). Next you can simply search a library of existing beers and see their ingredients and brew process. Lastly, you will be able to enter items you have already (ex: malt, hops, water) and see what beers you can make with them. Have two people wanting to coordinate, then you can add the list together, and see what your combined ingredients would make. Lastly, if possible, you will be ale to list things you want to share, such as, "hey, too much beer leftover from the last batch, come drink it!"



## Technology

Specific APIs, integrations and technologies you expect to use.

https://untappd.com/api/docs for the beer information

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/intro for the linking up between people to brew.

https://pusher.com/ for instant communication between users.


## Why you should help me build this

Make a pitch for a peer to help you with this project.

If you're interested in beer, bringing people together who share the same interests, and want to drink a ton of delectable beer while working on this, then join me in making Brew Live a reality!

P.S.-- I am 100% about divying up tasks, allowing people to work on their end and not take over, collaboration, and lastly, asking you how you would do things to make this app a f*&^ing rockstar application. Because, like beer, we only want the best. Unless you paid for Iron Yard tuition OoP, then whatever fits the budget but makes you feel better.üçª üçª
