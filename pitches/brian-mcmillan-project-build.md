## Benefits

Why said audience would use this thing? Users will use this application because it gives them a unified space to discuss all makes, models, and aspects of car builds, unlike other social media applications such as Instagram and Facebook that target a very broad group of users. It allows open discussion and a place to gather information for their own projects/builds in a community of fellow car enthusiasts.

## Why you should help me build this

Make a pitch for a peer to help you with this project.
I would like help on this project from anyone  that could see the untapped potential for a new social media site targeting car enthusiasts. Most people can appreciate a cool car and use the app just to browse or follow users/cars that intrigue them. Others express a passion for cars and could use the app to document their journey from stock to built, collect followers, discuss topics, and post their work up for the world to see. This app could pertain to anyone in between and lead to a whole new social media site focused on a cool cars.
