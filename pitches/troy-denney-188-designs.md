# 188 Designs Jewelry (Troy Denney)

## Elevator

I am going to create a e-commerce website that will allow the jewelry designer of 188 Designs to sell her custom Italian jewelry online.  With an online store this will allow the jeweler to broaden her client base as well as pass the savings from having a brick and mortar store on to her customers.


## Audience

The target audience for this site would primarily be jewelry lovers, but within that group 188 Designs sees two distinct groups that would primarily visit the website.  The first group that the jewelry designer is targeting is the budget conscious consumer that does not like mass produced products, preferring instead handmade items at an affordable cost.  The second group that the designer is targeting is the more discerning jewelry collector that takes pride in adding jewelry that is unique to a specific region to their collection.  For the collector who appreciates handmade custom Italian jewelry at a variety of price point this site would allow for them to buy pieces without having to travel.

## Benefits

While the target audience of the 188 Designs e-commerce site are small, the benefits are many for this clientele.  This site will allow jewelry lovers the ability to purchase handmade custom Italian jewelry.  The pieces are unique, they are authentic and are not made by a corporation in a factory.  Each beautiful piece is designed and made by an Italian artisan with 20 years of experience.  This site will allow customers to see a wide variety of inventory and price points that would not be unavailable to them otherwise without expensive travel to Italy.

## Features

The 188 Designs e-commerce site's primary function will be to feature and sell custom Italian jewelry.  The main feature of the site will be to maintain an inventory and process credit card payments that take into account the cost of the item, sales tax and shipping.

## Technology

Integration from the ground up using shopify.com as an inventory management system as well as be able to handle online payments.  We'll start with a small inventory and add as time goes on.  I'll also create a way for the designer to be able to maintain her own inventory and add products, which I believe shopify.com will be able to accommodate.  On the front end side I plan to use a variety of methods using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make the UX of the site as friendly as possible for online jewelry shopping.

## Why you should help me build this

If you are unsure of what you would like to build for your final project, I would welcome your help.  First you would gain valuable experience on the front end by helping to design a consumer website that sells a product.  Not only does it have to function, it has to be easy for the customer to understand.  Second you will gain experience with something we have yet to touch base on so far at The Iron Yard, using shoify.com as the back end of our site.  Third, with this experience you will learn how to set up your own e-commerce site.  One day you might want to set up your own business selling a product, and this project will help with that.  Fourth, I'm pretty chill to work with.  Thank you.
