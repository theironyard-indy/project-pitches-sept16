#### Option B. This needs more research. The "pain point" this addresses could also be a major pain in development. A lack of easily integrated information might make this a horrible exercise in data entry. 

## Elevator

Every major election we get inundated with coverage of the big races, the big scandals, the big news, and there's rarely any information readily available for voters trying to make an informed decision about their local elections. We could definitely use a social, searchable network of information for the smaller names on the ballot--that often have a bigger impact on our daily lives.

## Audience

Who will use this product/application/thing.

* Anyone who has had to flip a coin or leave a blank on the ballot for local elections.

* People who want to be more involved, more informed about local politics, but doesn't know where to find information.

## Benefits

Local elections can have more effect on our day to day lives the the national races we always hear so much about. An organized, centralized source for information, education, and discussion on local- and state-level races would help anyone make a more confident decision about how to vote.

## Features

* Provide access to an education database for local and state level elections ("What does x position make decisions about?").

* Provide platform information for candidates in smaller races, where major media coverage often misses ("How would x candidate make those decisions?")

* Provide a forum for user discussion, including the option for verified accounts from local candidates or campaign representatives ("How would x candidate respond to x issue?")

## Technology

Government voting records, publicly accessible civics education resources, discussion forum with verified accounts for candidates or campaign representatives to answer questions and provide feedback.

## Why you should help me build this

Low voter turnout and response is often an issue in local races and off-year election cycles, and a lack of accessible information is often cited as one of the leading reasons for this. A lot of this information _is_ available publicly, but it's not easily or intuitively accessible to the average voter. Parsing and presenting this available data in an intuitive, digestible format could go a long way toward improving the quality of local voters and candidates.
