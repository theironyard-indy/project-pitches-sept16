# Grain of Salt (Jon K.)

## Elevator

Why settle for restaurant reviews from the anonymous masses, when you can have reviews that come with the context of knowing the reviewer?

## Audience

Foodies, friends of foodies and people who can't seem to remember what they're friends have to say about cool new restaurants.

## Benefits

- Users have access to recommendations and reviews of restaurants from people they can trust
- Users have a fall back for dinner plans if they or their group are an indecisive.
- Users don't have to text their friend to remind them what was awesome at that new Taco place in Fountain Square

## Features
- Users can post reviews of restaurants and recommended specific dishes.
- Has a list of specific dishes from restaurants that a friend has recommended.
- Displays a map with nearby restaurants.
  - Users can click on a restaurant and bring up more information about it, including reviews posted by friends.

## Technology

- Google Places API
- Google Maps API
- database to store reviews and recommendations
- some front-end wizardry to display maps and make it all look nice!

## Why you should help me build this
I would love to have some help from anyone who is also wary of reviews on sites like yelp because you don't really know the reviewers typical standards for price, service etc.
