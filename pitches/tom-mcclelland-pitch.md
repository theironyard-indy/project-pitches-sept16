# Project Pitch Name (Tom McClelland)

## Elevator

The typical user of social networking sites isn't aware of the unsafe information they post that could put their homes and safety at risk.  This application will monitor social media accounts, flag and rate their posts for issues, and alert users to potential safety concerns for them to take action.  

## Audience

Common user - could use the application for their own knowledge to help them be safer online

Insurance companies - could use the application to help alert policyholders to these concerns to help reduce risk.

Military units - could use this to monitor soldier's accounts while deployed to keep that information from folks that could do harm.

Criminals - they could potentially use this site to see where these soft targets are for burglary.

## Benefits

All users would get the benefit that by opting into this type of monitoring they can feel safer and more secure.  The information they are sharing will not harm the safety of their families.  Also companies could offer an incentive for this monitoring to help everyone reduce risk.  Finally it could help expose this problem to users of these applications and educate them how to handle this material online.  

## Features
* Account profile for single user
* Organizational profile with ability to monitor multiple users activity.
* Historical tracking of alerts over time.
* Location based indicators of at risk location displayed on a map.
* Charting for organizations to give a more visual way to understand the risk profile of monitored users.
* Connection and authentication with major social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram)
* Display of negative posts with a rating system and explanation to user how to address issue.


## Technology

NodeJS, ReactJS, APIs(Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google Maps), OAuth, PostgreSQL, Adonis, ChartJS, Pusher

## Why you should help me build this

This project will be complex with many different features that can be developed much more efficiently with a team of developers.  Using ReactJS it can be broken down into components that allows for developers to focus on areas of the application that suits their skills.  Also by using NodeJS we can leverage our front-end experience with JavaScript on the server-side.
