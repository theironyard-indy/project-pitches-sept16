# Project Pitch Name (Zach Pinner)

## Elevator

Apple iOS 10 mobile application; Create handwritten notes w/ your finger (stylus)
and push them to your favorite social media applications (Twitter, Instagram and Facebook).

## Audience

My main demographic will be users invested into the Twitter / Instagram ecosystems.
These two applications are popular with users between the ages of 18 and 29.


## Benefits

Another way to express yourself across multiple social media platforms;
Although a simple idea some might find this form of expression striking.
Hand written notes could also be popular amongst users w/ a strong follower base.

## Features

Social Media integration (Twitter, Instagram and Facebook)

Your “Thoughts” will be pushed to your various timelines

Pick and choose where your “Thoughts” (note) is pushed or push to all three simultaneously.

Ability to take photos and place notes / messages on them.

Ability to send regular Tweets, Instagram and Facebook messages all in one application.

## Why you should help me build this

I’m looking for someone to work with that will be focused on delivering clean working application. I understand that this is not the most robust idea, but for this project i’m interested in having something that is not only functional but tangible.

What do I mean by tangible? I would like to have this application live on the Apple app store on demo day. I feel that #Thoughts is something that most users can identify with and I would love for them to be able to take it with them, try it out and give us feedback to make it even better.

Again. It’s a simple idea (we’ve only got three weeks); but as long as we focus on a clean interface, usability and functionality I know that this would be a hit on demo day.
