# Babel Fish (Sally Wieland)

## Elevator

As an unexperienced junior developer I often end up on blogs/articles that contain information that is too technical to understand without other resources, such as Mozilla Developers Network or W3Schools. I want to create a blog plugin/application that allows for the writers of these blogs to easily choose words or phrases to link directly to the corresponding resource’s page. This allows for the blog to not only be more accessible and understandable, but also creates a larger readership for the writer.

## Audience

Anyone who writes blogs about more technical fields and those who are interested in learning more about those topics.

## Benefits

* Easier learning experiences for new developers
* Quicker problem solving for both experienced and unexperienced developers
* More accessible blogs
* Allows for a larger audience for bloggers writing about technical topics

## Features

* Directly links specified words to a resource page (MDN, W3Schools, Wikipedia)
* Easily linked through putting asterisks around the word, or some other indication
⋅⋅* Bloggers don’t have to go back through and create the links, plugin does that work during writing process
* Icon that is clickable within the blog template that shows writer if plugin is activated/installed

## Technology

* JavaScript
* React
* WordPress plugin documentation
* MDN / W3Schools

## Why you should help me build this

We are all about to jump into the world of development where we will spend a lot of time Googling things we don’t know. We have been told time after time that in order to be successful, we need to continue learning everyday. I just want to make that process easier for all of us.
