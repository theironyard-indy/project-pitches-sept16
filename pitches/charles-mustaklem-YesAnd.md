# YesAnd... (Charles Mustaklem)

## Elevator

An app that is used as a tool by improv teams so they can house descriptions of improv games, create casting sheets and make life easier for the hosts of shows.

## Audience

Many improv teams have a hard time organizing casting sheets, descriptions of games, sound effects and suggestions from the audience. This would consolidate all aspects of an improv show into one space.

## Benefits

This gives different teams the ability to house their own database of games and casts that have been in use.

## Features

The app will have two types of Users. Admins and players. Admins can create casts, add games and upload specific sounds that will be used in shows. Players have the ability to view show information which includes: a full casting list, and individual slides of each game, which include a description of the game and the cast members within it.

## Technology

I would like to build this out by using React framework and Adonis for running the back-end.

## Why you should help me build this

This is an emerging new form of live entertainment, and the only existing apps, that pertain to improv, house different games and have zero interactivity amongst team members.
