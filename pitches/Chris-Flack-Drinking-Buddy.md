# Drinking Buddy (Chris Flack)

## Elevator

You've probably got that one friend or bartender who always knows a the right beer to recommend. With this app, you can always have access to personalized recommendations based on your tastes and history, not an aggregated score from a thousand strangers.

## Audience

Who will use this application?

* Anyone with an interest in trying new beers, without all the trial and error of the dartboard approach.

* Anyone who has poured out a $7, five-star beer they just couldn't stand.

* Travelers and out-of-towners unfamiliar with local options.

## Benefits

With all the ratings apps and websites out there, it's easy to find out what everyone else likes, but that doesn't always translate to something you will like.

## Features

Provide personalized, estimated ratings based on your user history, friend recommendations *(scope creep)*, or a "Try something new" option. Recommendations that are a miss can be blacklisted to improve future performance.

More scope creep/stretch goals: Definitions and education on terms and terminology to help with selections. Integration with web-accessible live draft lists. Bottle/can barcode reading. Beer-list/menu scanning.

## Technology

Specific APIs, integrations and technologies you expect to use.

* Untapped API can be imported for initial user profile.

* Other/TBD ratings sites for keyword association and comparisons for prediction. (RateBeer, BeerAdvocate, UnTapped again... There's a lot of options; I'll need to do some more research to find which would be most accessible/useful for this task.)

## Why you should help me build this

On a practical level: this is an application I know a lot of people would find useful on a fairly regular basis. After some initial research, there appears to be a pretty wide selection of APIs.

On the technical side: this is a proven model, with the addition of (and focus on), an important and apparently lacking feature, personalization. And again: data availability.
