# Project Pitch Name Soundscape

## Elevator

The idea of having a band, DJ, or even a sound system availiable at events often falls as a last minute issue. This relies on favors of people who HAVE the equipment, the client who needs the equipment, and the third person  who operates it. This excludes the venue who often does not know what they need. What if there was an app that could chart out the needed equipment, time, and configuration? This way bands, events, managers, operators of equipment and venues can have a positive experience.

## Audience

- Bands
- The everyday person who often doesn't run events,

This also takes away responsibility for paying for an operators specific skills in set-up of the configuration is done.
