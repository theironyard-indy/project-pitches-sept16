# Project Pitch Name (Your Name)
Droober (blending Uber and Drone imagery)
## Elevator

A one or two sentence synopsis of what your idea is:
- Why navigate the FAA for drone imaging rights; find and contract available drone pilots in your area with Droober.

## Audience

Who will use this product/application/thing.
- Examples exist for mining/mineral companies to gather 3d imagery for purposes of inventory (for large piles of raw materials usually requiring survey crews)
- Any industry with property needing audit
- Any industry needing to gather before, regular updated imagery, and after incident imagery.
- catastrophy modeling with 3d area rendering

Note: "Everybody" is not an acceptable answer.

Further note: Your idea might have a few different audiences.

## Benefits

Why said audience would use this thing. What do they get out of it?
- Navigating the FAA is easier than it used to be but maintaining a licensed pilot certified by the FAA for all regions of the US is not cheap.  Much less expensive to use Droober to put out a beacon for a location, image path/route on that location, and let the pilots pick up the job and return the imagery.

## Features

What the thing _does_. Note that this is different than the above.
- this app lets companies or people specify a zone, link their authorization to gather imagery for that zone (ownership or permit), and specify quality or type of imagery... then let drone pilots pick up the job and deliver the imagery for customer consumption.
- images with varying quality (including multispectral if/whenavailable for UV layers)
- Stretch goal to enable photogrametric image processing upon delivery as a service.
## Technology

Specific APIs, integrations and technologies you expect to use.
- http://services.faa.gov/
-- Without parsing available data yet, I would imagine a zone can be found and authorized pilots can be identified/notified somehow.
- https://developers.google.com/maps/
- React
- Something on the backend (Ruby/Rails, Adonis, Node)
## Why you should help me build this

Make a pitch for a peer to help you with this project.
- Because drones and 3d imagery

Note: if I don't do this but someone does and gets filthy rich.  I get 25% ownership.  :)
